# HousePricePrediction_Model_Comparison
## Workflow:
This project demonstrates **supervised learning**, where the model is trained using **labeled data** — input features like 'Rooms', 'Distance', 'Bathroom', etc., and the target variable 'Price'. 
The model learns patterns from the data to predict house prices for new examples.

## Models Used:
The following tree-based regression models are implemented and compared in this demo:
1. **Decision Tree Regressor** – a single tree model predicting target values by splitting data based on feature thresholds.  
2. **Random Forest Regressor** – an ensemble of multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve accuracy.  
3. **XGBoost Regressor** – a gradient boosting model that builds trees sequentially to correct previous errors, optimized for speed and performance.
